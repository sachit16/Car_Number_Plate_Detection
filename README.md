# Car Number Plate Detection

This project detects and extracts car number plates from a live video stream using OpenCV and a Haar Cascade classifier.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<username>/Car-Number-Plates-Detection.git
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the `car_number_plate_detection.py` script:

   ```bash
   python car_number_plate_detection.py
   ```

2. The script will open a window displaying the live video stream from your webcam.
   
3. When the script detects a number plate, it will draw a rectangle around it and display the extracted plate in a separate window.

4. Press the 's' key to save the extracted plate. The saved images will be stored in the `plates` folder.
